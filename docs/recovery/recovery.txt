On a device with no installed bootloader you can load U-Boot this way:

$ sunxi-fel uboot output/build/uboot-*/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin

When booting U-Boot whether over USB or not, pull PE9 low to enter fastboot
mode. This will also enable serial output from U-Boot and the kernel for
development purposes.

You can now load a kernel image (that may include an initrd) like this:

$ fastboot stage output/images/kernel.itb

The image must not exceed 32MiB or include a compressed initrd, as the
target has 128MiB of RAM and copying around large data takes a lot of memory.

To boot the kernel you will need to provide bootargs. For NAND it looks like
this:

$ fastboot oem run:'env set bootargs "rootwait ubi.mtd=ubi,0,0,0,1 ubi.fm_autoconvert=1 root=ubi:root rootfstype=ubifs"'

For a recovery initrd no bootargs are provided.

$ fastboot oem run:'env set bootargs ""'

Next, boot the image:

$ fastboot oem run:'bootm ${loadaddr}'

Continue on by running commands over SSH.
